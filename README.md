# velo_driver
This code is a optimized version of the [ros package driver](http://wiki.ros.org/velodyne_driver)ï¼Œ but with new features:

1. the determing angle, which defines a specific frame, saying a new circle frame starts and ends from this angle.
2. parallelly grabing pcap packages and transforming raw data into point clouds.
